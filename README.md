# Let me cook 🔥

Hi! My name is Simonee Ezekiel Mariquit, though if you come from UP you might know me better as Stimmie. 
- Engineering @ [E-Konsulta Clinic PH](https://www.ekonsultaclinic.ph/)
- Former Lead @ [HearthCraft](https://hearthcraft.net), a survival Minecraft server that ran 6 years (incl. the pandemic) and became a safe space for 10,000+ players
- Joined 10+ hackathons, game jams, and design challenges—met tons of people, heard brilliant (and not-so-brilliant) ideas, and explored new tech 

I spend _some_ of my time finishing my Bachelor of Science degree at the [University of the Philippines](https://up.edu.ph/). 

Some other chunk of my time is spent in my college organizations, volunteering, meeting new people, running, and lifting weights. Here are the organizations I'm involved with
- Academic Affairs @ [Alliance of Computer Science Students, UPLB](https://v2.acssuplb.org/)
- Internals @ UPLB Data Science Guild
- Finance @ UPLB Gavel Club, affiliate of [Toastmasters International](https://www.toastmasters.org/)
- Comp Prog @ [UP Algorithms Plus Plus](https://github.com/UP-Algorithm-Plus-Plus)
- START - DOST, an organization for [DOST-SEI](https://sei.dost.gov.ph/) scholars in the field of tech

Right now I'm particularly interested in studying data science, game development, and computer vision. I also like building stupid projects for the fun and memes.
