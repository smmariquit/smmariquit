# Let me cook 🔥

Hi! My name is Simonee Mariquit, though if you come from UP you might know me better as Stimmie. I spend _some_ of my time finishing my Bachelor of Science degree at the [University of the Philippines](https://up.edu.ph/). Some other chunk of my time is spent in my college organizations, volunteering, meeting new people, and doing some form of exercise!

While CS and the theoretical concepts behind it really interests me, I understand that there is so much more to life to tech and sitting behind a computer. Much of my student life revolves around finding some sort of balance in that aspect!

Right now I'm particularly interested in studying data science, game development, and computer vision. I'd love to be part of your project!
